Utilities for loading URDF files and STL geometry into Unity

![Example](../docs/unity-example.gif)

## Use
```cs
StreamReader reader = new StreamReader(".../path/to/urdf");
string content = reader.ReadToEnd();
URDFRobot ur = URDFLoader.BuildRobot(".../package/dir", content);
```

## API
### URDFLoader
#### LoadRobot(urdfPath, package, options) : URDFRobot
Reads and processes the urdf at the given path, returning a `URDFRobot` that describes the whole robot.

##### urdfpath : String
The path to the URDF file relative to the specified package directory.

##### package : String | Dictionary<string, string>
If the package is just a string then it replaces the `package://` portion of the path.

If it is a dictionary then it represents a list of packages by `packageName : packagePath` so that multiple packages can be specified.

##### options : URDFLoader.Options

_optional_

Set of options for the loader.

#### BuildRobot(urdfContent, package, options) : URDFRobot
Same function as above, but this function takes the raw contents of the urdf file rather than a path.

##### urdfContent : String

The urdf content to parse into a robot.

##### package : String | Dictionary<string, string>

See `LoadURDFRobot`.

##### options : URDFLoader.Options

_optional_

Set of options for the loader.

### URDFLoader.Options

Struct with a set of optional fields to augment the behavior of the loader.

##### loadMeshCb : System.Action<string, string, System.Action<GameObject[]>>
A function for loading geometry in a custom way or in unsupported formats. `URDFLoader.LoadMesh` is used by default.

The function is passed a path to the model, the models file extension and a callback to pass an array of game objects when finished.

##### target : URDFRobot
An existing URDFRobot to build the robot in to.

##### workingPath : String

The directory to use to resolve relative file paths in the URDF. Defaults to the URDF directory when using `LoadRobot`.

### URDFRobot
#### SetAngle(name, rad)
Sets the angle (in radians) of the joint with the given name. Throws an error if the joint does not exist.

#### TrySetAngle(name, rad) : Boolean
Same as above, but does not throw an error. Returns `true` if it was able to set the angle.

#### GetAnglesAsDictionary() : Dictionary<string, float>
Returns a new `Dictionary<string, float>` with the current angle of all the joints on the robot.

#### SetAnglesFromDictionary(angles)
Takes a `Dictionary<string, float>` and sets all the angles on the robot that are listed in the dictionary.

## Limitations
- The Collada model loader currently does not support textures or materials and loads the models with an offset rotation ([Issue #52](https://github.com/gkjohnson/urdf-loaders/issues/52))
